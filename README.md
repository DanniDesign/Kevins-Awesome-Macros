# [Sequential Purging Macro](https://github.com/Department-of-Design/Kevins-Awesome-Macros/blob/main/sequential_purge.md) (ðŸ“–DOCUMENTATIONðŸ“–)
This incredible macro ensures that you won't have to fret about forgetting to remove your purge line from your bed. While the macro itself doesn't remove the purge line automatically, it does provide a buffer, minimizing the chance of error by always accommodating the previous purge line from the previous print.
